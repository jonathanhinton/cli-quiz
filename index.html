      <h2>My Sister’s Funeral</h2>
      <p> Since there was no mother for the peach tree we did it <br>
          all alone, which made the two of us closer <br>
          though closeness brought its loneliness, and it would <br>
          have been better I think sometimes to be sterile <br>
          from the start just to avoid the pain <br>
          which in my life this far has lasted seventy <br>
          years for I am in love with a skeleton <br>
          on whose small bones a dress hung for a while, <br>
          on whose small skull a bit of curly hair <br>
          was strung, and what is dust I still don’t know <br>
          since there was no mother to turn to then and ask <br>
          what else was she wearing, did she have on shoes, <br>
          and were the two trees from Georgia, and was it <br>
          true somebody said the other peach <br>
          should have died instead of her; and I could <br>
          imagine the nose going first though forty years later <br>
          the trees were still there and not as big as you’d think; <br>
          and it was my cousin Red with the flabby lips <br>
          who said it, he had red eyes, a red monstrosity, <br>
          a flabby body, half the house was filled with <br>
          male cousins, they were born in rooms a <br>
          short distance from the rats, I can’t remember <br>
          which ones had the accents nor what his <br>
          Hebrew name was, nor his English. <br>

      <h2>Sonnet [Nothing was ever what it claimed to be,]</h2>
      <p> Nothing was ever what it claimed to be, <br>
          the earth, blue egg, in its seeping shell <br>
          dispensing damage like a hollow hell <br>
          inchling weeping for a minor sea</p>

      <p> ticking its tidelets, x and y and z. <br>
          The blue beneficence we call and spell <br>
          and call blue heaven, the whiteblue well <br>
          of constant water, deepening a thee,</p>

      <p> a thou and who, touching every what— <br>
          and in the or, a shudder in the cut— <br>
          and that you are, blue mirror, only stare</p>

      <p> bluest blankness, whether in the where, <br>
          sheen that bleeds blue beauty we are taught <br>
          drowns and booms and vowels.  I will not.</p>
